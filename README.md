# Udacity Project: Analyze E-commerce AB Test Results

## Project Overview
Project is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program to analyze A/B Test Results for an e-commerce website. 
The dataset used is one of Udacity's curated datasets.

The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users conversions 
(users who decide to pay for the company's product). Goal is to work through this notebook to help the company 
understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Outline of Analysis
* Understanding the data
* Cleaning messy data for analysis
* Hypothesis testing via bootstrapping and standard statistical tests (p-value and z-score calculations)
* Logitic regression and multiple linear regression modelling to assess relationship between independent variables

## Key Findings
There is no evidence to suggest a significant impact of the new page on user conversion or any impact of the country of the user
on the conversion rate between the new and old page.
